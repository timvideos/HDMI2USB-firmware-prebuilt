  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:163 - Bus sda driven by tbufs will be transformed to use
   combinational drivers.
WARNING:Pack:2549 - The register "edid_hack0/edid_master/sdaout" has the
   property IOB=TRUE, but was not packed into the OLOGIC component. The output
   signal for register symbol edid_hack0/edid_master/sdaout requires general
   routing to fabric, but the register can only be routed to ILOGIC, IODELAY,
   and IOB.
WARNING:Pack:2549 - The register "edid_hack0/edid_slave/sdaout" has the property
   IOB=TRUE, but was not packed into the OLOGIC component. The output signal for
   register symbol edid_hack0/edid_slave/sdaout requires general routing to
   fabric, but the register can only be routed to ILOGIC, IODELAY, and IOB.
WARNING:Pack:2549 - The register "edid_hack1/edid_slave/sdaout" has the property
   IOB=TRUE, but was not packed into the OLOGIC component. The output signal for
   register symbol edid_hack1/edid_slave/sdaout requires general routing to
   fabric, but the register can only be routed to ILOGIC, IODELAY, and IOB.
WARNING:Timing:3159 - The DCM, testpattern_comp/patternClk_com/dcm_clkgen_inst, has the attribute DFS_OSCILLATOR_MODE not set to
   PHASE_FREQ_LOCK. No phase relationship exists between the input clock and CLKFX or CLKFX180 outputs of this DCM. Data paths between these
   clock domains must be constrained using FROM/TO constraints.
WARNING:Pack:1653 - At least one timing constraint is impossible to meet because component delays alone exceed the constraint. A timing
   constraint summary below shows the failing constraints (preceded with an Asterisk (*)). Please use the Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE
   (command line) with the Mapped NCD and PCF files to identify which constraints and paths are failing because of the component delays
   alone. If the failing path(s) is mapped to Xilinx components as expected, consider relaxing the constraint. If it is not mapped to
   components as expected, re-evaluate your HDL and how synthesis is optimizing the path. To allow the tools to bypass this error, set the
   environment variable XIL_TIMING_ALLOW_IMPOSSIBLE to 1.


   For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing Analyzer Reference manual; for more information on TRCE,
   consult the Xilinx Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 368 block(s) removed
 189 block(s) optimized away
 817 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

INFO:Timing:3386 - Intersecting Constraints found and resolved.  For more 
   information, see the TSI report.  Please consult the Xilinx Command Line 
   Tools User Guide for information on generating a TSI report.
INFO:Timing:3284 - This timing report was generated using estimated delay 
   information.  For accurate numbers, please refer to the post Place and Route 
   timing report.
Number of Timing Constraints that were not applied: 11

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
