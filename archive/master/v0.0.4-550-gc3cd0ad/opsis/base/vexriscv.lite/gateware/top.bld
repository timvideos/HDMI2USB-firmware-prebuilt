WARNING:NgdBuild:1345 - The constraint <TIMESPEC "TSclk100" = PERIOD "PRDclk100"
   10.0 ns HIGH 50%;> [top.ucf(80)] is overridden by the constraint <TIMESPEC
   "TSclk100" = PERIOD "PRDclk100" 10.0 ns HIGH 50%;> [top.ucf(85)]. The
   overriden constraint usually comes from the input netlist or ncf files.
   Please set XIL_NGDBUILD_CONSTR_OVERRIDE_ERROR to promote this message to an
   error.
