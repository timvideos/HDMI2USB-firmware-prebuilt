2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
AVAL-46#1 Critical Warning
v7v8_mmcm_fvco_rule1  
The current computed target frequency, FVCO, is out of range for cell MMCME2_ADV. The computed FVCO is 1500.000 MHz. The valid FVCO range for speed grade -2 is 600MHz to 1440MHz. The cell attribute values used to compute FVCO are CLKFBOUT_MULT_F = 30.000, CLKIN1_PERIOD = 10.00000, and DIVCLK_DIVIDE = 2 (FVCO = 1000 * CLKFBOUT_MULT_F/(CLKIN1_PERIOD * DIVCLK_DIVIDE)).
This violation may be corrected by:
  1. The timer uses timing constraints for clock period or clock frequency that affect CLKIN1 to set cell attribute CLKIN1_PERIOD, over-riding any previous value. This may already be in place and, if so this violation will be resolved once Timing is run.  Otherwise, consider modifying timing constraints to adjust the CLKIN1_PERIOD and bring FVCO into the allowed range.
  2. In the absence of timing constraints that affect CLKIN1, consider modifying the cell CLKIN1_PERIOD to bring FVCO into the allowed range.
  3. If CLKIN1_PERIOD is satisfactory, modify the CLKFBOUT_MULT_F or DIVCLK_DIVIDE cell attributes to bring FVCO into the allowed range.
  4. The MMCM configuration may be dynamically modified by use of DRP which is recognized by an ACTIVE signal on DCLK pin.

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP lm32_cpu/multiplier/product0__0 output lm32_cpu/multiplier/product0__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP lm32_cpu/multiplier/product0 multiplier stage lm32_cpu/multiplier/product0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

PDRC-33#1 Warning
MMCM_adv_ClkFrequency_div_dclk  
The computed value 1500.000 MHz (CLKIN1_PERIOD, net clk100_clk) for the VCO operating frequency of the MMCME2_ADV site MMCME2_ADV_X1Y0 (cell MMCME2_ADV) falls outside the operating range of the MMCM VCO frequency for this device (600.000 - 1440.000 MHz). The computed value is (CLKFBOUT_MULT_F * 1000 / (CLKINx_PERIOD * DIVCLK_DIVIDE)). Please adjust either the input period CLKINx_PERIOD (10.000000), multiplication factor CLKFBOUT_MULT_F (30.000000) or the division factor DIVCLK_DIVIDE (2), in order to achieve a VCO frequency within the rated operating range for this device.
Please note that this check is a Warning because the DCLK pin has an ACTIVE signal and it is assumed that dynamic control (DRP) will be exercised to put the VCO frequency into valid operating range.

REQP-165#1 Advisory
writefirst  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (lm32_cpu/instruction_unit/icache/memories[0].way_0_tag_ram/mem_reg) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
