INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'PRDclk100', used in period specification
   'TSclk100', was traced into BUFIO2 instance BUFIO2. The following new TNM
   groups and period specifications were generated at the BUFIO2 output(s): 
   DIVCLK: <TIMESPEC TS_clk100b = PERIOD "clk100b" TSclk100 HIGH 50%>

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'PRDclk100', used in period specification
   'TSclk100', was traced into DCM_CLKGEN instance crg_periph_dcm_clkgen. The
   following new TNM groups and period specifications were generated at the
   DCM_CLKGEN output(s):

WARNING:NgdBuild:1345 - The constraint <TIMESPEC "TSclk100" = PERIOD "PRDclk100"
   10.0 ns HIGH 50%;> [top.ucf(68)] is overridden by the constraint <TIMESPEC
   "TSclk100" = PERIOD "PRDclk100" 10.0 ns HIGH 50%;> [top.ucf(73)]. The
   overriden constraint usually comes from the input netlist or ncf files.
   Please set XIL_NGDBUILD_CONSTR_OVERRIDE_ERROR to promote this message to an
   error.
