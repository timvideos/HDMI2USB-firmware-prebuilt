These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/top_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/top_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

Block RAM mem_1_reg originally specified as a Byte Wide Write Enable RAM cannot take advantage of ByteWide feature and is implemented with single write enable per RAM due to following reason.
address width (13) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 tag_mem_reg has an input control pin tag_mem_reg/ENBWREN (net: tag_mem_reg_ENBWREN_cooolgate_en_sig_1) which is driven by a register (FDPE_1) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

WARNING: [DRC CFGBVS-1] Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties: Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]

Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 tag_mem_reg has an input control pin tag_mem_reg/ENBWREN (net: tag_mem_reg_ENBWREN_cooolgate_en_sig_1) which is driven by a register (FDPE_1) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
INFO: [DRC REQP-165] writefirst: Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (lm32_cpu/instruction_unit/icache/memories[0].way_0_tag_ram/mem_reg) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
